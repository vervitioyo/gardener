This link will take you to a MediaFire page where you can download a compressed file named "epson\_px660\_adjustment\_program\_free\_download.rarbfdcm". This file contains the adjustment program and some instructions on how to use it. However, before you download it, you will need to verify that you are not a robot by completing a captcha challenge.
 
Once you have downloaded the file, you will need to extract it using a program that can handle RAR files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a folder named "Epson PX660 Adjustment Program" with several files inside. One of them is named "AdjProg.exe", which is the main executable file of the adjustment program.
 
## Step 2: Run the Adjustment Program
 
Before you run the adjustment program, make sure that your Epson PX660 printer is connected to your computer and turned on. Then, double-click on the "AdjProg.exe" file to launch the adjustment program. You should see a window like this:

The adjustment program has several options and features, but for our purpose, we only need to use the "Particular Adjustment Mode". Click on this option and you will see another window like this:

This window shows different types of adjustments that you can perform on your printer, such as head cleaning, nozzle check, alignment, etc. However, to reset your printer's counters, you need to select the "Waste Ink Pad Counter" option and click OK. You will see another window like this:
 ![Waste Ink Pad Counter Window](https://i.imgur.com/0YsQnQK.png) 
This window shows the current values of your printer's waste ink pad counters, which indicate how much ink has been absorbed by the pads during printing and cleaning cycles. When these counters reach their maximum values, your printer will stop working and display an error message.
 
To reset these counters, you need to check the boxes next to "Main Pad Counter" and "Platen Pad Counter", and then click on the "Check" button. The program will read the current values of the counters and display them in the "Reading Now" column. Then, click on the "Initialization" button to reset the counters to zero. The program will ask you to confirm your action and warn you that this will clear all print jobs from your printer's memory. Click OK to proceed.
 
The program will then perform the initialization process and display a message saying that it has been completed successfully. Click OK to close the message and then click Finish to exit the adjustment program.
 
## Step 3: Restart Your Printer
 
After resetting your printer's counters with the adjustment program, you need to restart
